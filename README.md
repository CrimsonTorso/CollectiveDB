# CollectiveDB
A basic file searcher, which finds strings or chars that have been defined by a user. 

# PRE-REQUIREMENTS:

* Python3
* Grep
* Linux (Either using a VM or live version)
* Some .txt or similar files

# ABOUT THIS TOOL:

This tool has been made to allow for an easier search technique rather than going through every individual file to find
information or a specific set of words.

# [WARNING]

[!] I am not responcible with the data you get with this tool! [!]
